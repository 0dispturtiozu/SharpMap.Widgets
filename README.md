[SharpMap](https://sharpmap.codeplex.com/) is a powerful mapping library that supports many standards and formats.
But the interactive Web- and Windows-Widgets of the SharpMap project are not up to date.
SharpMap.Widgets shows how to combine the SharpMap renderer with map widgets 
like [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) or [Ptv xServer.NET](http://xserver.ptvgroup.com/en-uk/cookbook/explore/xserver-net-demo-center/).
So it combines the power of SharpMap with the Look&Feel of modern widgets.

### What the project shows
* Efficiently render large data sets with SharpMap for "slippy" map widgets
+ Implementing SharpMap interfaces to render your custom data source
+ Sharing your map business-code between web and desktop applications

### The basic technique

### ToDos
* Add interaction (picking) for Win-Demo
* Enabling/disabling SharpMap layers
* Some dynamic filtering and styling
* Better sample data sources
* More docs
