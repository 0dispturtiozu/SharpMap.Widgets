The route is set shortly after 2000, representing a time when overgrown vegetation and abandoned buildings ran rife across the network. You can see the contrast between the new infrastructure and the old, as well as the stunning terrain that surrounds the railways. The route is packed with intricate details such as lifelike overhead wires, animated lifts at stations, detailed countryside and towns packed with life. You will also find over 1000 custom 3D models that enrich this virtual world, including individual churches for each village and a replica of the Trier Cathedral in Altenburg.
 
The add-on includes 11 engaging career scenarios, complete with train and station announcements as well as driver/dispatcher dialog. You can drive a variety of trains on different services, such as coal trains, local trains, interregio trains, steam excursions and special services. You can also enjoy the route in free roam mode or create your own scenarios with the included rolling stock and assets.
