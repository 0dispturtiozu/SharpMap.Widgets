## What Can You Do with iZotope Ozone 5?
 
iZotope Ozone 5 features many independent modules, including two equalizers, a harmonic exciter, a reverb, a multiband compressor, and a maximizerâ working together seamlessly and synergistically to give you all of the tools you need to create professional sounding tracks[^2^]. You can use these modules in any order and combination that suits your needs and workflow. Here are some of the things you can do with iZotope Ozone 5:

- Use the equalizers to shape the tone and balance of your mix. You can adjust the frequency spectrum using various filter types, such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, shelf, bell, or tilt. You can also use musical equalization to create a boost or notch corresponding to a note value rather than a frequency value[^3^]. You can also process separate channels independently using mid/side or left/right modes[^4^].
- Use the harmonic exciter to add warmth and character to your mix. You can apply different types of saturation, such as tube, tape, retro, warm, or dual triode, to each frequency band. You can also adjust the amount, frequency, drive, mix, and stereo width of the saturation effect.
- Use the reverb to add depth and space to your mix. You can choose from six reverberation algorithms: room, theatre, plate, hall, cathedral, or arena. You can also adjust the reverb time, size, pre-delay, diffusion, damping, early reflections, late reflections, wet/dry mix, and stereo width.
- Use the multiband compressor to control the dynamics of your mix. You can apply compression to each frequency band separately using various modes: digital (transparent), analog (vintage), IRC I (intelligent), IRC II (intelligent), IRC III (intelligent), or IRC IV (intelligent). You can also adjust the threshold, ratio, attack, release, knee shape 8cf37b1e13
